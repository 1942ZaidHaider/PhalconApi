    <description compact="The RuleWatchGraph efficiently propagates decisions to other rules">All rules generated for solving a SAT problem should be inserted into the
graph. When a decision on a literal is made, the graph can be used to
propagate the decision to all other rules involving the literal, leading to
other trivial decisions resulting from unit clauses.</description>

      <description compact="Inserts a rule node into the appropriate chains within the graph">The node is prepended to the watch chains for each of the two literals it
watches.

Assertions are skipped because they only depend on a single package and
have no alternative literal that could be true, so there is no need to
watch changes in any literals.</description>

      <description compact="Propagates a decision on a literal to all rules watching the literal">If a decision, e.g. +A has been made, then all rules containing -A, e.g.
(-A|+B|+C) now need to satisfy at least one of the other literals, so
that the rule as a whole becomes true, since with +A applied the rule
is now (false|+B|+C) so essentially (+B|+C).

This means that all rules watching the literal -A need to be updated to
watch 2 other literals which can still be satisfied instead. So literals
that conflict with previously made decisions are not an option.

Alternatively it can occur that a unit clause results: e.g. if in the
above example the rule was (-A|+B), then A turning true means that
B must now be decided true as well.</description>
